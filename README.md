# Code Quiz

## Description

As a bootcamp student I want to be able to take a quiz relating to coding to gauge my knoweledge on various topics of web development.
This application was built in order to polish and implement skills learned in module 4 of the coding bootcamp; including variable production,
DOM manipultaion, DOM queries, creating DOM elements, appending elements, intervals and timers, event listeners, local and session storage, and data attributes.
This application solves the problem of wanting coding practice, utilizing both a physical, deployed application, and building said application using VS code.
During this module, I learned the importance of JS fundamentals and how to implement them in a simple web application, quizing users on the fundaments of web development.

## Tests

Application progress is still under construction. Questions to be added and functionality to be polished before the end of January 2023. Current issues include:

1. Timer will not stop the flow of questions when it reaches 0.

2. There are currently not enough questions.

3. The user has to log their own score, I would like to build out functionality where the computer tracks correct and incorrect answers.

4. Local Storage of high-scores does not currently work, needs adjustment. Also, the display of past high scores is a planned, future addition to the application.

5. CSS is severly lacking, further design and optimization planned for the future.
