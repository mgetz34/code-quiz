# Code Quiz

## Description

As a bootcamp student I want to be able to take a quiz relating to coding to gauge my knoweledge on various topics of web development.
This application was built in order to polish and implement skills learned in module 4 of the coding bootcamp; including variable production,
DOM manipultaion, DOM queries, creating DOM elements, appending elements, intervals and timers, event listeners, local and session storage, and data attributes.
This application solves the problem of wanting coding practice, utilizing both a physical, deployed application, and building said application using VS code.
During this module, I learned the importance of JS fundamentals and how to implement them in a simple web application, quizing users on the fundaments of web development.
